### Manual testing with a maliciously modified wallet client

We also performed a number of tests against the cold staking code using a maliciously modified wallet client in an attempt to exploit potential weakness in the code. None of these attempts managed to find an exploit.  
Details can be found under [release-notes-4.5.0-additional-testing-notes/modified-coldstaking-client-notes-4.5.0.md](release-notes-4.5.0-additional-testing-notes/modified-coldstaking-client-notes-4.5.0.md)

To not vote for this soft fork, add the following line to your `navcoin.conf` file:

You can also pass this as a launch argument:  
`./navcoin-qt -rejectversionbit=3`

## Reject specific version bits by default

<[Pull Request 336](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/pull/336)>
<[Commit eb6a1a2](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/commit/eb6a1a27903a477306a7ef73d3d85bd52ff1f3c4)>

By default the wallet votes yes for soft forks included in the wallet. This changes adds a list (empty at the moment) of version bits which will be voted no by default, while also adding an option to manually vote yes for those bits.

To manually vote yes for a version bit add the following to  your `navcoin.conf` file:
`acceptversionbit=15`

You can also pass this as a launch argument:  
`./navcoin-qt -acceptversionbit=15`

## Block header spam protection fixes

<[Pull Request 335](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/pull/335)>
<[Commit 210a22d](https://github.com/NAVCoin/navcoin-core/commit/210a22daaffbd36d90a5ee0121c0c4ce3de0ed75)>

The wallet will now only accept a minumum number of block headers from a single peer before banning them for misbehaving. This is an anti-spam measure and is customizable via the config file or via launch arguments.

The new launch arguments are:  

`-headerspamfilter=<0 or 1>` -  1 will turn the filter on (it is on by default), and 0 will turn it off.

`-headerspamfiltermaxsize=<number>` - The number you wish to set as the new max size.

`-headerspamfiltermaxavg=<number>` - The number you wish to set as the new max average.
